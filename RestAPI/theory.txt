-------->>>>> A REST API (Representational State Transfer - Application Programming Interface) is a standardized way to allow communication between client and server using HTTP methods. It is widely used in web development and mobile apps to connect frontends with backends.

ðŸ”¹ WHAT IS REST API?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
A REST API allows systems to interact using standard HTTP methods like:

GET â€” Retrieve data

POST â€” Send new data

PUT â€” Update data

DELETE â€” Delete data

It uses stateless communication â€” meaning each request contains all information needed; the server doesnâ€™t remember previous requests.


ðŸ”¹ WHY DO WE USE REST API?
âœ… Benefits:
Platform Independent (works with mobile, web, desktop apps)

Stateless and Scalable

Lightweight (uses JSON or XML)

Easy to Use (based on standard HTTP methods)

Separation of Concerns (Frontend & Backend are decoupled)




ðŸ”¹ HOW CLIENT & SERVER COMMUNICATE (FLOW)
Client (frontend): Sends HTTP request to API endpoint.

Server (backend): Processes request, performs logic/database interaction.

Server: Sends back an HTTP response (usually in JSON).

Client: Updates UI using the response.



âœ… SUMMARY
REST API lets clients and servers communicate using HTTP and a consistent structure.

It uses CRUD principles mapped to HTTP methods.

It is stateless, scalable, and works with any client.

Most web and mobile apps today use REST APIs for backend interaction.



STATELESS ===> In REST, "stateless" means that each request from the client to the server
            must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, 
            and the server does not store any memory (state) of previous interactions.........
