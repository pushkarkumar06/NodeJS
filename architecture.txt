How does Node Js Work ?

Ans -> It start with a client , 
    * client send request to the server , then nodejs push that request to the event loops .....
        * then event loop checks is it non blocking or blocking task (synchronous or Asynchronous) ......
            * if it is  Asynchronous (non blocking) -> then event loop handle that it self and process it and send back to the  client as a response ......     (Default thread pool size -> 4)
            * if it is Synchronous (Blocking request) -> then event loop send that particular request to the "Thread Pool" (basically it contains some limited thread which assign to some incoming blocking task) , after that , when a particular blocking proccessed by thread , so send it back to event loop and event loop send it back to the cliet as a response ..... 
                * when the all Threads got bussy in processing of some incoming blocking request , so the remaining blocking request waits until thread become free .....
