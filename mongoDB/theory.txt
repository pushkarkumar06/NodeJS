MongoDB and Node.js are commonly used together to build modern web applications because they naturally complement each other:



ðŸ”¹ Relation Between MongoDB and Node.js
    MongoDB	                                                            Node.js
-> A NoSQL database	                                        -> A JavaScript runtime for building servers
-> Stores data as BSON/JSON-like documents	                -> Handles data as JavaScript objects
-> Used for storing data	                                -> Used for processing and serving data
-> Offers fast, flexible, schema-less storage	            -> Offers event-driven, non-blocking server environment




ðŸ”¹ How They Work Together
-> Node.js server receives a request (e.g., from a form).

-> It uses a MongoDB driver or ODM (like Mongoose) to interact with MongoDB.

-> MongoDB stores or fetches data and sends it back.

-> Node.js processes that data and sends a response to the client.



ðŸ”¹ Why Theyâ€™re Commonly Used Together
-> Both use JavaScript/JSON-style data.

-> Node.js is asynchronous and works well with MongoDBâ€™s fast I/O.

-> Mongoose makes it easy to define models/schemas.

-> Perfect for building REST APIs, CRUD apps, real-time apps, etc.
